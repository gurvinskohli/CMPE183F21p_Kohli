<h2> Introduction </h2>

PyChain is an implementation of a simple blockchain with a focus on ease of deployment within applications. PyChain allows a user to add a transaction to a block, chain that block, and validate the chain. These three commands are run on terminal and the output is also viewable by terminal commands. The validation feature is given emphasis on the implementation side. Malicious activity can be detected with the help of exceptions that get thrown. Python was chosen for this implementation as the input of transactions to the blockchain becomes very flexible due to Python’s auto data type assigning. Python also has a very intuitive syntax for hash pointers which in PyChain’s case act as hash functions between blocks.
